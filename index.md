### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3, is one of my favorites because it changes colors or gradients using codes which is amazing. I was able to learn new things like Magick and get better in understanding nested loops. This project has also helped me in getting comfortable coding a function file and a main file separately.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1, is one of my favorites because I was able to learn how to read sentences backwards. Also, palindrome is an unfamiliar word for me and this lab helped me understand it even better. I was also able to get better at using input file streams.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 is one of my favorites because it helped me understand how scores work in blackjack. Even though our code is less experienced in this lab we were able to make this code work. This code also calculates the total score of the player and tells if it is bust or not.
